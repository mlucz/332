In order to set up the system call we had to implement the function in "proc.c".
It grabs a lock on the ptable and checks for the number of used slots.
A getter function was added in "sysproc.c".

Further, the following had to be modified:
syscall.c - fucntion def to connect shell and kernel
syscall.h - define position of syscall vector
user.h - fucntion header
usys.s - macro to connect user call to syscall
defs.h -

A simple test program was used to test the functionality.
Makefile had to be modified to add the test program to user programs.
